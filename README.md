- 👋 Hi, I’m @danny1227
- 👀 I’m interested in developing solutions for SMEs and small companies that need management and development in their processes.
      I like to administer and manage complete projects, and work with work groups that are motivated and focused on objectives.
      This can be in languages I know such as java, I would also be interested in taking on new challenges such as developing in languages I don't know.      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new languages for web development, in backend or frontend, I would like to be a fullstack developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects and testing to detect web errors.
- 📫 You can reach me in danielcoroy1200@gmail.com
